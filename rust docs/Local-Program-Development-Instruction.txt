To get started with Solana locally, youâ€™ll first need to install Rust and the Solana CLI.

solana config get => To check the default/current config in your system.

solana config set --url localhost | devnet | mainnet-beta => To set the RPC Url to the devnet, local or mainnet-beta.

solana-keygen new --outfile ~/<FILE_PATH> => To create a new keypair and store it in a file.

At times you may need to check which keypair your configuration is pointed to. To view the publickey of the current keypair set in solana config, use the solana address command.

=> solana airdrop 2 
// This commands will get/set the address, balance, airdrop of your solana config Keypair Path.

=> Hello World

1. Deep access in Rust. Like we do in javascript
 => item.name (js) === item::name (rs) example: use solana_program::account_info::AccountInfo

2. Declaring Functions in Rust
 => fn process_instruction()

3. For Reference 
 => &


4. Module System
 * Modules - A module separates code into logical units to provide isolated namespaces for organization, scope, and privacy of paths
 * Crates - A crate is either a library or an executable program. The source code for a crate is usually subdivided into multiple modules.
 * Packages - A package contains a collection of crates as well as a manifest file for specifying metadata and dependencies between packages
